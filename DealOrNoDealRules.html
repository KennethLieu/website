        <h1>Deal or No Deal Rules: </h1>
        <p1>
            The game will start off with 20 cases. They will range from $2 to $10 million.
            Your goal is to walk away with as much money as you can, and hopefully win the grand prize 
            of $10 million! You will select one case to keep, and eliminate other cases one by one.
            After removing certain number of cases, you will be offered cash amount for your case by the banker.
            The biggest question here is: Deal or No Deal? Take the deal, and you will win the cash amount the 
            banker offers. Not take the deal, and you will resume removing other cases until there is 2 cases left:
            your case and the last remaining case. When you reach that point, you will be given a last chance of keeping
            your case or switch your case with the other case and take whatever is in that case. After the game ends, you 
            will be offered a mystery case to open. You can choose to take it, free of charge, and it will apply a random
            multiplier to your total $ amount. Multipliers include x0, x0.5, x1, x2, and x4. If you don't take it,
            you will walk away with the amount you left the game with. Take the risk, if you dare!
