            , but with 2 additional cards:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. LIGHTNING card
            <br>
            2. PARDON card 
            <br>
            <br>
            LIGHTNING card is a WILD card which when used, you can select a color, and STUN the next player for 1-3 turns.
            However don't fret, as the stunned player will have a chance to be freed via coin flip. If you take coin flip, it
            will land on SUCEESS or FAIL. Landing on SUCCESS means you will be freed from STUN effect, cancel any effects 
            (DRAW 2, DRAW 4, SKIP), played on you prior to your turn, and you will have a turn as if nothing happened. However, landing 
            on FAIL means you will suffer any DRAW2, DRAW4, SKIP effects played on you, and will remain stunned. 
            <br>
            <br>
            PARDON card is a SPECIAL card. It is not a normal UNO card you can pick up, but when you draw a normal UNO card, you will 
            have a chance of picking up a PARDON card. Once one is picked up, another cannot be received by anyone until the original is used. A PARDON card can be used when you get hit with a DRAW 2, DRAW 4, LIGHTNING, and SKIP 
            is played on you. When used, you will be freed from the effects and will be able to take your turn like normal. You CANNOT 
            use a PARDON card to free yourself from STUN effect.
